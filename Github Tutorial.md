# Tutorial for Github.

	- To demonstrate versioning we will need to go over a hundful of important functions and which ones a user will need to know vs the project manager.

		♦ As we go through the functions we will cross them off and update this document to demonstrate the functionality.

			○ Set up Repository aka "Repo" : This is done easily in github desktop by clicking "New Repository" filling out the neccessary information "Name - Create Readme - Licensing" then clicking Create Repository.

			○ Create Branch: Create a branch so that way all of the changes you make to the document get stored as a seperate file.

			○ Make a change "Edit": This is done locally once a branch has been made. (Demonstrate with open file explorer)

			○ Commit: Save Edit LOCALLY. Name of work done & Details must be filled out.

			○ Push: This will save the changes you made locally to github.

			○ Clone: This will make a copy of a repository from github.

			○ Clone vs Fork: Fork is used just like clone but focuses on "Pull Requests" to update the main file. Should be used when main file shouldnt be updated too often. 

			○ Administrator tasks: (Merge - Pull Requests -settings)
